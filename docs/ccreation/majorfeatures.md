## Step 1: Major Features

The first thing which you need to do is get some of the "major features" of your character on paper.

---

On your character sheet, please write down the following things:

* Character Name
* Character Age
* Character Gender
* Character Race
* Character Height
* Character Weight

You can follow the actual rulebook way of doing most of these elements, rolling dice to randomly determine elements, but that may feel limited or stupid. Feel free to skip the book and just write these as you please.

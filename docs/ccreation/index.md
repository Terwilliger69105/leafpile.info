## Character Creation

Welcome to character creation, the first (and possibly most important) thing you should do for playing in any tabletop role-playing game!

---

In an effort to make this easy, and in an effort to minimize confusion, you will only need the following things:

* A copy of the **Cyberpunk 2020** core rulebook **CP3002.2**
* This website
* One six-sided die (1d6)
* One ten-sided die (1d10)
* One "percentile" die (1d% **or** another d10)

---

Pages are organized in first to last order. Hyperlinks will be provided whenever needed, remember that middle-mouse clicking opens something in a new tab.

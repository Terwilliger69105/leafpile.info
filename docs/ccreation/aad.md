## Step 4 - Advantages and Disadvantages

Time for one of the elements not present in the core rulebook, a bit janky but a good time for sure.

---

You can take a set of Advantages and Disadvantages, extra little special values which may be "bought" using Advantage Points (APs) to give your charactere extra special features. 

To determine how many APs you have:

*APs = (INT Stat * 3) + Role Modifiers*

---

Now, with your total APs, it's time to get to actually "buying" Advantages and Disadvantages. To "buy" an Advantage, subtract the #AP value from your total APs. To "buy" a Disadvantage, add #APs to your total APs. You may not "buy" more than 12APs worth of Disadvantages.

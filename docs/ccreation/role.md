## Step 2: Role

Now, with the basics on paper, we can move onto the things which you need this guide for!

---

Deviating from the core rulebook, roles in *The Leaf Pile* are entirely different than the usual. Please ignore the core rulebook and skip past the Roles section. Instead, go take a look through the [Roles](/info/roles) page.

---

Found your role? Awesome! If your role has a "Max Players" value, and there's a good chance it does, message your GM about having said role and stop right here. Role requests will be processed in a "first come first served" manner, by time and date, and GMs will make sure to post when roles have hit their player cap in chat. If not, or if your role has been confirmed, move onto the next section!

Can't find a role you like? We fully expect that to happen. You have two options at this point, both require you to message your GM:

1. Ask for a new role, maybe more in line with whatever you prefer, and all GMs will work together to try and help you out.
2. Ask for the "Roleless" package.

## Stats

*The big nine.*

---

Each player in *The Leaf Pile*, the same as *Cyberpunk* has **nine** core statistics. These represent their abilitiy to do various activities, physical and mental, which are deemed important enough to have skills. These are rated from 2 to 10, 2 being horrible and 10 being superhuman, with the average person falling somewhere from a 4 to a 6.

---

The following pages are by-the-book descriptions and examples of each of the nine stats. They're arranged in "Character Sheet" order, the order which the original *Cyberpunk 2020* character sheet had them placed, and will always be able to be viewed. Certain stats have "sub-stats" which are mentioned on the Character Creation Stats page, they will be placed under their parent stat with a better description as to what they are.

## Cool

"The Cool index measures how well your stand up to stress, fear, physical 
pain and/or torture."

This stat is more commonly used as a check to see just how "together" your
character is, determining if you'll have modifiers on upcoming rolls alongside 
a few skill checks.

Common COOL Rolls:
* Speaking Checks - **Cool** + *Most Relevant Skill* + 1d10
* Composure Checks - **Cool** + 1d10

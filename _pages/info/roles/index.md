## Roles

Something unique in comparison to our usual reference material, Roles in *The Leaf Pille* are character elements which help to cement your desired skillset. They come in not only a paper form but sometimes also physical additions, a good chunk of the "light ARG" elements which the GMs desire including.

It doesn't exist for *Test Game* but, for the future, some roles may be count-limited. These will require you to message your GM during character creation to request, it **must** go on record that you asked for it, and requests will be handled in a first-come first-served manner.

---

Roles in *Test Game* are going to stay simple, physical elements staying to a minimum, and there will only be a handful to pick from. Want to view these? Click through the sidebar to see what all is available!

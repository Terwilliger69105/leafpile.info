## Gear

An important thing to *most* characters in a Tabletop RPG. You may not need it but you may find it really helpful.

---

Much of the gear listed here, as with any game of the sort, is going to:

* Deal damage to someone
* Prevent you from taking damage
* Regenerate damage done to you

For the time of writing (2/21/2022) this makes the most sense as **Test Game** will be held in a simpler fashion. Eventually, whenever this goes to a full game with full setting, we will include things of more use than just combat.

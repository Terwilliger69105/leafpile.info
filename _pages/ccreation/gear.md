## Step 7 - Gear

The second-to-last, close to most important, and possibly the most fun thing thing you have to do.

---

There are six types of gear within *The Leaf Pile* including:

* Weapons
* Armor
* Mods
* Consumables
* Fashion
* Other

[Head to the Gear pages](/info/gear) and spend your money on as much, or as little, as you want. Remember to take your free "Company Package" listed on the main Gear page!

There should be a link saying to "Roll Your Lifepath" but that may just be cut out for the test games. Consider this, as-of 2/21/2022, the stopping point for your sheet.

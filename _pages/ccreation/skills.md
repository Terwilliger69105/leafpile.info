## Step 5 - Skills

Finally, something similar to the core book, it's time to go through that big section of skills.

---

First things first, before you move further, **you may take any skills you want.** 

There is no role restriction, there is no limiting factor, and there won't ever be something that says "no skill for you" in the game. It may not be advisable to take certain skills, I can tell you that Stock Market is a poor pick when you're on a space station, but that's just on you.

---

Everyone, unless their role says otherwise, gets **40 Skill Points** (SPs) at the start of the game. Assign these as you please. Remember, the max you may have in a skill (by default) is 10 points.

### Modifications

Please take note of the following:

All **Special Abilities**, *except for **Interface** and **Medical Tech** which are now TECH skills*, are removed from the game and invalid choices.

**Brawling, Fencing,** and **Melee** are now all represented by the single **Melee* skill.

## Step 2: Role

Now, with the basics on paper, we can move onto the things which you need this guide for!

---

Roles in The Leaf Pile **do not** match up with the roles in Cyberpunk 2020. These are not skill restrictions and special abilities, instaed being a set of bonuses and specalizations you gain at the start of your game.

Take a look through the [Roles](/info/roles) page, open it in a new tab, and browse for a role which seems fun. If none look interesting, an issue which may occur, stop right here and contact your GM.

When you've decided which role you want, check if it has a **Max Players** value. If it does, please contact your GM before going further. They'll check to see if the role cap is reached and respond back as soon as possible. If it doesn't, write your role down and continue onwards!

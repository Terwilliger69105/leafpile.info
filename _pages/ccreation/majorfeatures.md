First things first, before you move on, you're going to need to make the following major elements:

* Character Name
* Character Age
* Character Gender
* Character Race
* Character Height
* Character Weight

You can follow the actual rulebook way of doing most of these elements, rolling die on tables to see what happens, but it may feel limited or stupid. Feel free to just come up with these on your own.

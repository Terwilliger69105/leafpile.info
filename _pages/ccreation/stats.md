## Step 3 - Stats

With the big parts out of the way, the things which probably determine how you want to play, let's roll the first set of dice.

---

In case you didn't read, don't remember, or don't feel like referencing the core rulebook, the nine major stats are:

* INT (Intelligence)
* REF (Reflexes)
* TECH (Tech)
* COOL (Cool)
* ATTR (Attractiveness)
* LUCK (Luck)
* MA (Movement Allowance)
* BODY (Body)
* EMP (Empathy)

---

To determine your stats, don't follow the core rulebook. There is no point buy system, you're not rolling 1d10 nine times straight down, or whatever else they suggest. 

**Roll 9d6.** Reference the table below:

```
Die Result | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 
Stat Value | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 6 
```

So, for example, let's say you roll **2, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2**. This would mean that you may assign the values **4, 4, 6, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3** across your nine stats. You're not adding these numbers, just take one and place it wherever you feel it fits.

---

There are also some stat-based values which you should write down.

**Reputation** always starts, unless your Role says otherwise, at **0**.

**Humanity** is equal to your **EMP Stat** multiplied by **10**.

**Run** is equal to your **MA Stat** multiplied by **3**.

**Leap** is equal to your **Run** divided by **4**.

**Lift** is equal to your **BODY Stat** multiplied by **40**.

**Save** is equal to your **BODY Stat**.

**BTM**, Body Type Modifier, can be determined by the table below:

```
BODY Stat | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5-7 | 8-9 | 10 | 11+
BTM Value | 0   | -1  | -2  | -3  | -4 | -5 
```

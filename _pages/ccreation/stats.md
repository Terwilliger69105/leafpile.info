In case you don't remember, or don't feel like referencing the core rulebook, the nine major stats are:

* INT (Intelligence)
* REF (Reflexes)
* TECH (Tech)
* COOL (Cool)
* ATTR (Attractiveness)
* LUCK (Luck)
* MA (Movement Allowance)
* BODY (Body)
* EMP (Empathy)

Determining stats is simple enough, start by rolling **9d6.** Reference the table below for each roll:

| Die Result | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stat Value | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 6 |

So, for example, you roll **2, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2**. This would mean that you may assign the values **4, 4, 6, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3** across your nine stats.

There are also some stat-based values which you should write down.

**Reputation** always starts, unless your Role says otherwise, at **0**.

**Humanity** is equal to your **EMP Stat** multiplied by **10**.

**Run** is equal to your **MA Stat** multiplied by **3**.

**Leap** is equal to your **Run** divided by **4**.

**Lift** is equal to your **BODY Stat** multiplied by **40**.

**Save** is equal to your **BODY Stat**.

**BTM**, Body Type Modifier, can be determined by the table below:

| BODY Stat | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5-7 | 8-9 | 10 | 11+ |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|
| BTM Value | 0   | -1  | -2  | -3  | -4 | -5  |

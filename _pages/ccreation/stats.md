In case you don't remember, or don't feel like referencing the core rulebook, the nine major stats are:

* INT (Intelligence)
* REF (Reflexes)
* TECH (Tech)
* COOL (Cool)
* ATTR (Attractiveness)
* LUCK (Luck)
* MA (Movement Allowance)
* BODY (Body)
* EMP (Empathy)

Determining stats is simple enough, start by rolling **9d6.** Reference the table below for each roll:

| Thing      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Die Result | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Stat Value | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 6 |

So, for example, you roll **2, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2**. This would mean that you may assign the values **4, 4, 6, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3** across your nine stats.

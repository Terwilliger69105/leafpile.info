Welcome to **leafpile.info**, a project page for a little variation on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop role-playing game rule set! This site is designed to allow anyone, no matter how inexperienced with tabletop role-playing games, to create a character and get a grasp on the rules which will commonly be used throughout the course of the game.

Looking to create a character? Want to know what some weapon you just got does? Trying to find out how Netrunning works? This site will have everything you need!

Enjoy,
*Andrew T.*

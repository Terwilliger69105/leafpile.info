Welcome to **leafpile.info**, a project page and guide to *The Leaf Pile.* Starting out as a set of modifications to the *Cyberpunk 2020* ruleset, potentially (eventually) morphing into a thing of its own, *The Leaf Pile* is hopefully something that some people may find enjoyable.

This site should be designed to allow anyone, with maybe a slight amount of help from the GM, to create a character and get themselves playing in *The Leaf Pile.*

Looking to create a character? Want to know what some weapon you just got does? Got some cryptic link as a part of a mission? This site will have everything you need!
